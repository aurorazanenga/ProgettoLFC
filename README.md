# ProgettoLFC
This is a university project completed under the supervision of Professor Giuseppe Psaila and Professor Paolo Fosci for the "Formal Languages and Compiler" course.
It was developed by me and my colleague, Benedetta Lenuzza.
In the documentation folder, you will find the project's technical documentation, user manual, and an elevator-pitch style presentation.
In the exampleFiles folder, you will find some example files to run the code.
